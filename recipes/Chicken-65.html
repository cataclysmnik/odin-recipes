            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Minced garlic and ginger</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Serrano peppers</li>
            <li>Cumin powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Red chile-garlic paste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add egg, cornstarch, 1/2 of the minced garlic, 1/2 of the minced ginger, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until chicken is completely coated.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet and fry chicken pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set fried chicken aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a second skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until crackling, about 1 minute. Add remaining garlic, remaining ginger, serrano peppers, cumin, chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt. Add curry leaves and stir to combine. Add chile-garlic paste, ginger paste, and red food coloring. Stir to create a paste. Add water to thin paste slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Add fried chicken to the the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in cilantro.
            </li>
        </ol>
